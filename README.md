# Retirement_Forecasting
The goal of this data project is to create a retirement simulator to see the effects of portfolio investments that are fully invested in the stock market, aggressively invested, moderately invested or conservatively invested.

This idea came from a retirement simulator that I built in excel.

The included Jupyter notebook shows the coding utilized to create a database of future return rates for the stock market, including a series of managed portfolios (aggressive, moderate and conservative).
